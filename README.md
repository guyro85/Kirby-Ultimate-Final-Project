# Kirby-Ultimate-Final-Project
An improved version of the assembly project, this game features multiplayer, animations and AI  
This game was made as a final project for my highschool CS class.

# The files:
The kirby multiplayer game.docx file contains a detailed explenation of the game.
Most of the files are pictures used within the code.
The code files are divided into 6 files: client.py, client2.py, ai.py, server.py, network.py, kirby.py

# How to run the game:
Make sure that all the files are in the same folder.
Open the server.py and network.py files using any code editor and change the value of the server parameter to 
the ip address of the computer that you are running the server script on.
On one computer run the server.py script. 
The game uses the pygame python library so you have to make sure you have it installed on the environment
Run the client.py script on both computers that you are playing from using pycharm or any other environment.

# Notes:
The game will only work on your Local Area Network.
The client2.py script is here if you want to run the 2 players on the same machine.
Make sure that both players have all of the files in the same folder before playing.
Run the game via pycharm or simillar environment.
Make sure you have the pygame library installed on your environment
